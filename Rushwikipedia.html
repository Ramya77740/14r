  <p>Rush is a 2013 biographical sports film centred on the rivalry between two Formula One drivers, Briton James Hunt and the Austrian Niki Lauda,[12] during the 1976 motor-racing season.

<h3>plot</h3>
<p>James Hunt, a brash and self-confident individual, and Niki Lauda, a cool and calculating technical genius who relies on practice and precision, are exceptional racing car drivers who first develop a fierce rivalry in 1970 at a Formula Three race in London, when both their cars spin before Hunt wins the race. Lauda takes a large bank loan from Austria's Raiffeisen Bank to buy his way into the BRM Formula One team, meeting teammate Clay Regazzoni for the first time.<p>
